It takes place June 3rd to 7th at San Jose's McEnery Convention Center, the same venue as the last couple of years. At WWDC, Apple typically gives developers (and everyone else) an early look at upcoming versions of iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. We might also learn a little more about Apple's services (it's likely to announce streaming video and news subscription plans this month) or even get a glimpse at new hardware. \n\n If you are interested in attending, you have until March 20th to register for the chance to buy tickets. Otherwise, you'll be able to watch live streams of the keynote (which takes place June 3rd) and conference through the WWDC app or the Apple Developer website.", bookmarked: true)
